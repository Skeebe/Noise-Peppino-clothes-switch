# Noise Peppino clothes switch mod
I made this in like a day but it works for the most part, anyways heres some info abt the mod.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all costumes for both are changed as I didn't bother editing the palettes which I might do in a future update.
Also noise only has nine patterns and peppino has like 15 so not all of peppinos will be changed.
I also added a secret skin for both.

# HOW TO USE!!!

Use the "import.bat" script and it will backup your files in folder and import the new file.
Use "export.bat" file to backup the modded file to this folder and imports the unmodded one to revert changes, CAUTION The "export.bat" script wont replace your pizza tower file if the og unmodded file is not backed up with import.
